# Front End Boilerplate Dev Setup

## Description

This "template" is quite fleshed out to anticipate many of a front-end project's needs. You can examine the package.json and gulpfile.js files and prune down what you don't need. There are various pre-built gulp tasks within the "gulp/tasks" subdirectory - you can prune these down/modify as needed.
